Lets go out to get in tonight
킥보드 타고 ridin' around

Let's go out to get in tonight
킥보드 타고 ridin' around

I found you found me no time to let you alone
We forgot the time when got no homies around

I found you found me no time to let you alone
We forgot the time when got no homies around

I'm ready to ride behind you
Feel how cool is standin' together on the board
각자 길을 찾아 가는 중인 친구들 사이 나는 이상했지

Why they still talkin about being adults
It's the reason that you differents
Although your older than other whos 'wanna be adlut', still being kid

Maybe we should gotta go
우리가 떠나는 곳은 쭉 뻗은 도로마저도 괜찮아
Good friend got the big dreams that i have dreamed

Lets go out to get in tonight
킥보드 타고 ridin' around

Let's go out to gettin tonight
킥보드 타고 ridin' around

I found you found me no time to let you alone
We forgot the time when got no homies around

I found you found me no time to let you alone
We forgot the time when got no homies around

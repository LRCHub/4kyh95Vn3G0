I've been feelin' lonely
I need someone to hold me
Come on, baby, hold me (yeah)

Yeah, I've been feelin' jaded
Don't know how I should play it
Tell me how to play it (yeah)

Now you, you've been movin' on
Let me know, can I come along?
Since you're gone, oh, its been so long
On my own, my own, my own, my own

Livin' in a haze, stayin' in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break, can I get an "Amen"?
All I do is sit around and wait for better days

Leggo
Aleluya
Y dejamos que aquí todo fluya baby
Aleluya
Tú eres más mía que tuya, (yeah, yeah)
Sabes que mi domicilio siempre es express
Viajamos por el mundo en mi jet no hay estrés

Tus amigas que me odian
Les duele que tú seas mi novia
Pero yo te como a ti (yeah)
Te parto como maniquí
Como Dragon Ball Z te sientes Mi Ki (yeah)
Por ti me pego un viaje de Medellín a Beijing (yeah)

Livin' in a haze, stayin' in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break, can I get an "Amen"?
All I do is sit around and wait for better days

Can I get an Amen
Introverted can't make friends
Pray for better days now it's 300k when my day ends

Do you remember last night 'cause I blacked out
In that all white dress with her back out
Say be careful with her heart 'cos its fragile
And thinking bout her past make her lash out

See with me it ain't no worries at all
Any problem I'll be there when one call
If we locked in, you my dawg
Fan of you I'll hang pictures on my wall

Roll one let's get high tonight
Backseat Maybach lavish life
Chilling with the stars like a satellite
AP on my arm and it's shining bright

Living in a haze, staying in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break, can I get an amen
All I do is sit around and wait for better days

Better better better days
I can use a break
Better better better better

All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Better days
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
